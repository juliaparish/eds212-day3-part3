```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Using the c() function, create and store two new vectors, called vec_a and vec_b, where a⃗ =(1,6) and b⃗ =(2,4):

```{r}
# Vec_a

vec_a <- c(1 , 6)

```

```{r}
# vec_b

vec_b <- c(2 , 4)

```

## Check your by-hand solutions from Part 1 by finding the following in R:


```{r}
vec_c <- vec_a + vec_b

```

```{r}

vec_d <- vec_b - vec_a

```
## Vector scalar multiplier:

```{r}
vec_e <- 4 * vec_a

```

## The correct operator for a Dot Product is %*%

```{r}

vec_f <- vec_a %*% vec_b

```
